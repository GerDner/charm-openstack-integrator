      The base64-encoded contents of a JSON file containing OpenStack credentials.

      The credentials must contain the following keys: auth-url, username, password,
      project-name, user-domain-name, and project-domain-name.

      It could also contain a base64-encoded CA certificate in endpoint-tls-ca key value.

      This can be used from bundles with 'include-base64://' (see
      https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/charms-bundles#setting-charm-configurations-options-in-a-bundle),
      or from the command-line with 'juju config openstack credentials="$(base64 /path/to/file)"'.

      It is strongly recommended that you use 'juju trust' instead, if available.
